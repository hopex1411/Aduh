**Discord BOT aka. JÃ¸rgke**

<img src="https://github.com/hopex1411/portfolio-backup/blob/master/images/discordbot.gif"/>  

My newest project was creating a Discord BOT that would combine multiple BOT's features into a single BOT, while keeping all the old features and being able to easily add new. It was setup in DigitalOcean on a Fedora server & I used RedBOT, DiscordJS & Discord.py for this project. I could have chosen to make it fully manually using nodeJS, but that would be too big of a task for a single person.

The main goals was to have:

**Auto-mod:** 
The BOT can recognize bad behaviour and take action against people breaking the rules, without the need of an actual person.

**Temporary-Voicechannels:** 
If someone didn't want to communicate in a public voicechat, they automatically get a private-voicechat they "own" until they leave it, and then the voicechat automaticlly gets deleted.

**Logs over activity:** 
The bot will create an embedded message in a private channel for the serverowner, where it shows if someone gets muted, banned, kicked, message deleted, and other statitics

**Music Player:** 
With a single command, the BOT can join a voicechannel and play music with a link the use provide

I combined the names of a few previous bots, JÃ¸rgen + Rikke & got the name JÃ¸rgke.
